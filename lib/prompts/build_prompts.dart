The purpose of the app is: $prompt

The files we have decided to generate are: $files

The shared dependencies (like filenames and variable names) we have decided on are: $shredDependencies.

Only write valid code for the given filepath and file type, and return only the code.

Do not add any other explanation, only return valid code for that file type.

Make sure to have consistent filenames if you reference other files we are also generating.

Remember that you must obey these things: 
  - The dart code should be null safe, do not forget to add '?' to variables that are not initialized.
  - do not stray from the names of the files and the shared dependencies we have decided on
  - MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL - consider always the purpose of the app.
  - Always just generating the code.

every line of code you generate must be valid code. Do not include code fences in your response, for example:
  Bad response:
  ```dart 
  print("hello world")
  ```
  Good response:
  print("hello world")

# Weather App

## Description
The Weather App is a simple and intuitive mobile application that provides users with up-to-date weather information for various locations. Users can easily check the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecasts for the next few days.

## Features

- Current Weather: The app fetches data from a reliable weather API and displays the current weather conditions for the user's selected location. It includes information such as temperature, weather description (e.g., sunny, cloudy), humidity, wind speed, and direction.
- Forecast: Users can view the weather forecast for the upcoming days, including temperature highs and lows, and weather conditions. The app can display forecasts for a specific number of days, typically up to seven days.
- Location Search: Users can search for weather information in different locations by entering the city name or ZIP code. The app should support auto-suggestions to make it easier for users to find their desired location.
- Backgrounds and Icons: The app can dynamically change the background and weather icons based on the current weather conditions. For example, if it's raining, the app could display raindrops falling on the screen or show an umbrella icon.
- Unit Conversion: Users can switch between different units of measurement for temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit) and wind speed (kilometers per hour, miles per hour) based on their preferences.
- Offline Support: The app can store weather data locally, allowing users to access previously searched locations and their corresponding weather information even when they are offline.
